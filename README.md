## üîë Key Features Explained

### Translation Service Flow
1. Users select document type, languages, and service options
2. Users upload documents and provide contact information
3. Admins review and provide a quote
4. Users make payment via Stripe
5. Admins process the translation and upload completed documents
6. Users receive notification and can download completed translations

### Credential Evaluation Flow
1. Users provide details about their education and credentials
2. Users upload supporting documentation
3. Admins review and evaluate the credentials
4. Admins provide US equivalency or rejection reason
5. Users receive notification with evaluation results

### API Integration
Partners can integrate with OpenEval to programmatically submit credential evaluation requests:
1. Partners obtain API key from their dashboard
2. Partners submit requests via the API
3. OpenEval processes the evaluation
4. Partners receive webhook notification with results
5. Periodic invoicing for API usage

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)

npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
INVOICED_API_KEY=your_invoiced_api_key
```

4. Start the development server

## üìù API Documentation

### Overview

The OpenEval Partner API allows you to integrate credential evaluation services directly into your application. Submit evaluation requests programmatically and receive results via webhooks.

**Base URL**: `https://www.openeval.com/api`

**Live Documentation**: Available at [https://www.openeval.com/api-docs](https://www.openeval.com/api-docs)

### Getting Started

1. **Create an Account**: Register at [https://www.openeval.com/register](https://www.openeval.com/register)
2. **Generate API Key**: Navigate to your dashboard's "Integrations" section
3. **Configure Webhook**: Set up a secure HTTPS callback URL for receiving results

### Authentication

All API requests must include a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual secret key (starting with `sk_`).

### Submit Quote Request

Submit credential evaluation details to initiate a quote request.

**Endpoint**: `POST /v1/quote-requests`

**Headers**:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "country_of_education": "India",
  "college_attended": "University of Delhi",
  "degree_received": "Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science",
  "year_of_graduation": 2020,
  "notes": "Optional notes about the request."
}
```

**Required Fields**:
- `country_of_education` (string): The country where the education was received
- `college_attended` (string): The name of the college or university attended
- `degree_received` (string): The name of the degree with major concentration (e.g., "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science")
- `year_of_graduation` (number): The year of graduation or end year of enrollment (integer)
- `notes` (string, optional): Any additional notes relevant to the request

**Example Request (cURL)**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://www.openeval.com/api/v1/quote-requests \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "country_of_education": "India",
    "college_attended": "University of Delhi",
    "degree_received": "Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science",
    "year_of_graduation": 2020,
    "notes": "Optional notes about the request."
  }'
```

**Success Response (201 Created)**:
```json
{
  "message": "Quote request received successfully",
  "quote_request_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
}
```

> **Important**: Store the `quote_request_id` to correlate with the callback later.

### Webhook Callbacks

Once our team processes the request and determines the US Equivalency, we will send a `POST` request to your configured Callback URL.

**Callback Payload (Completed)**:
```json
{
  "quote_request_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "status": "completed",
  "us_equivalent": "Bachelor's Degree in Engineering",
  "unable_to_provide": false
}
```

**Callback Payload (Rejected)**:
```json
{
  "quote_request_id": "def456uvw",
  "status": "rejected",
  "unable_to_provide": true,
  "rejection_reason": "Degree required on Native language"
}
```

### Webhook Security (HMAC Verification)

To ensure callbacks genuinely originate from OpenEval, we include a signature in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header. This signature is an HMAC-SHA256 hash generated using your **Webhook Secret** and the raw request body.

**Verification Steps**:
1. Compute HMAC-SHA256 signature using your Webhook Secret and the raw request body
2. Compare your computed signature (prefixed with `sha256=`) with the `X-Webhook-Signature` header value
3. If they match, the request is authentic
4. Reject requests with invalid signatures

**Important**: Your endpoint should respond with a `2xx` status code (e.g., 200 OK) quickly to acknowledge receipt. Process the callback data asynchronously.

### Error Responses

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created (for successful quote requests)
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- `422` - Unprocessable Entity (validation errors)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

### Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting. Contact support if you need higher limits for your integration.

### Support

For API support, contact us through your dashboard or email support@openeval.com.

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are hashed before storage
- Webhook payloads are signed with HMAC for verification
- File uploads are secured with signed URLs
- Role-based access control for admin functions
- Environment variables for sensitive credentials

## ü§ù Third-Party Integrations

- **Stripe**: Payment processing
- **Invoiced.com**: Invoice generation and management
- **Clio**: Legal practice management integration
- **Supabase**: Database, authentication, and storage
